				<h1>Buildings in Barcelona</h1>
				<h2>What makes Barcelona's architecture distinctive?</h2>
				<p>Bold, brash, colourful, distinctive, harmonious,varied and unique are just a few adjectives that come to mind when describing Barcelona architecture Barcelona has successfully blended the old and the new in a way that makes this city simply breathtakingly beautiful. There is nothing more enjoyable than strolling around the streets of Barcelona and taking in the atmosphere that radiates out from the architecture. Traditional Catalan Gothic architecture such as the Iglesia de Pi church is reserved and stoic in its design, but just a 5 minuet walk away we have the Barcelona Cathedral with is beautiful arches and facade. A short metro ride we have the famous Sagrada familia Basilica which towers into the sky and has different architectural styles on all four sides of the building.</p>
				<p>Barcelona is often praised by architects for its town planning. You will notice as you walk around the city that buildings on corners have a flat edge - this is known as a 'chamfered corner'. It means that crossroads have a more open feel and there is room on street corners for terraces - this helps to give Barcelona its sociable and communal atmosphere.</p>
				<p>Barcelona's Avenida Diagonal is also praised by architects and town planners. It is a large street that runs diagonally right through the centre of the city. When it was built it was a very original piece of town planning.</p>
				<p>Central Barcelona can be separated into three main areas. The old town or Barri Gotic which was the original Barcelona. Characterised by winding old streets and tall dark buildings ancient buildings. The Raval area which was an extension to the original old town and finally Eixample which is the large organized &quot;grid&quot; structure area that was appended to the old town. Each area has its own very unique and distinctive character. To learn more about Barcelona's neighbourhoods see our pages on the Barcelona barrios</p>
